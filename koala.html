                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their distinctive appearance, with large ears and a stout body. Koalas primarily eat eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals.</p>
                    <p>They are mostly nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in trees. Koalas are also known for their unique vocalizations, which can be heard during mating season.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E20, right next to the insect house.</p>
