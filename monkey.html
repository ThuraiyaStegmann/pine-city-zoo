                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are primates of the infraorder Simiiformes, which includes all monkeys, apes, and humans. They are generally considered to be intelligent animals, with some species exhibiting complex social structures and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are known for their agility and dexterity, often using their hands and feet to grasp objects. They are typically found in tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions, where they live in troops or bands.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E20, right next to the insect house.</p>
