                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to China. They are known for their distinctive black and white fur and their gentle demeanor. Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up 99% of their diet.</p>
                    <p>They are solitary animals, spending most of their time alone in the wild. Pandas are also known for their playful behavior, often climbing trees and rolling around on the ground.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E20, right next to the insect house.</p>
