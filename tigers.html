                    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is a carnivore, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Tigers are territorial and generally solitary but social animals; they mark their territory with scent marks, scrape marks, and vocalisations.</p>
