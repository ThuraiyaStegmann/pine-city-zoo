                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh desert environment, able to survive without water for long periods by obtaining moisture from the vegetation they consume. They are social animals, often found in herds, and are known for their agility and speed.</p>
                    <p>These animals are primarily grazers, feeding on grasses and shrubs. They are also known for their ability to withstand extreme temperatures, making them well-suited for life in the desert.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are generally peaceful animals, but they can be aggressive when threatened. They are known for their impressive fighting abilities, using their long horns to defend themselves against predators.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gemsboks at pen E30, near the entrance to the desert exhibit.</p>
