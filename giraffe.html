                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is a member of the genus Giraffa in the family Giraffidae, which also includes its closest extant relative, the okapi.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are known for their long necks, which allow them to reach high branches and foliage. They are social animals, often found in groups called towers. Giraffes primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs.</p>
                    <p>They are also known for their distinctive coat patterns, which vary between subspecies and serve as camouflage in their natural habitat.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are generally peaceful animals, but they can be aggressive when threatened. They have a unique way of walking, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which gives them a distinctive gait.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E20, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
